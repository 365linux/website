111001%Applescript and Notational Velocity%applescript-and-notational-velocity.html%October 1, 2011%Sat, 01 Oct 2011 00:00:00 CDT%<p>In an earlier post, I explained <a href="http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=153">how I use plain text files and Notational Velocity as a task-management alternative</a> to the GTD program <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>. Towards the end of that post, I also hinted that I have been able to automate parts of my system by using some Applescript and Automator tricks. Most of these tricks depend on using an apparently little-known feature of Notational Velocity, which is the ability to perform the “search” command on your notes using Applescript.</p>
100920%In Which I Digitally Archive Some Articles%digitally-archive-articles.html%September 20, 2010%Mon, 20 Sep 2010 00:00:00 CDT%<p>Several months ago, I learned about Rice University’s <a href="http://scholarship.rice.edu/">Digital Scholarship Archive</a>, an institutional repository where faculty members can store and share published and unpublished work online. Many universities now have such repositories, including the <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/55467/browse?type=dateissued&amp;submit_browse=By+Date">University of Michigan</a>, <a href="https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a>, and others. But as Shane Landrum (<a href="http://twitter.com/cliotropic/status/21352071993">@cliotropic</a>) recently suggested, I’m not sure history faculty are widely aware of these repositories. I know that without a tip from the great Lisa Spiro (<a href="http://twitter.com/lisaspiro">@lisaspiro</a>), I might not have learned of Rice’s DSA at all. But I’m glad I did, and here’s why and how I’ve posted some of my published work to the repository.</p>
110717%H-Net 2.0?%h-net-2.html%July 17, 2011%Sun, 17 Jul 2011 00:00:00 CDT%<p>Several years ago now, <a href="http://edwired.org/2007/09/10/the-end-of-h-net/">Mills Kelly wrote a provocative post</a> suggesting that the future of <a href="http://www.h-net.org/">H-Net</a> was bleak. After noting that the traffic on many of H-Net’s edited, subject-specific e-mail lists was declining, Kelly argued that e-mail lists had outlived their usefulness for scholars online. “If H-Net is going to survive into a second decade,” he said, “I would urge its leadership to give up on email and move on. Digital communities in the Web 2.0 world just aren’t created in email any more.”</p>

His tips showed how to add different search engines to Google Chrome, but it got me thinking about how I could do something similar from the command line. A few bash functions later, I now have an easy way to search Google Scholar, Flickr, IMDb, and even proprietary databases in my university library—all in the browser of my choice. For example, say I want to search Google Scholar. At the command line, I can now just type this:</p>
120501%Two Simple Timers%two-simple-timers.html%May 1, 2012%Tue, 01 May 2012 00:00:00 CDT%<p>Like <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/an-everyday-essential-the-timer/22675">Natalie Houston</a> and the Profhacker gang, I sometimes use a timer to keep me on task when I need to be productive, especially when the tasks at hand are ones that I’d rather put off. But instead of investing in a full-blown timer program, I’ve hacked together two simple timers for my Mac that I can fire up whenever I need them. Both are rough around the edges, but they work for me.</p>
120925%Before Juneteenth: The Emancipation Proclamation in Texas%before-juneteenth-talk.html%September 25, 2012%Tue, 25 Sep 2012 00:00:00 CDT%<p>In 1926, the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> began publishing a serial comic strip on Texas history. It ran for only two years, but it shaped the way that generations of Texas schoolchildren learned about their state’s past. And it highlights the uncertain place of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texans’ memory of the Civil War.</p>
120710%Introduction to My Book%book-introduction.html%July 10, 2012%Tue, 10 Jul 2012 00:00:00 CDT%<p>On April 14, 1865, hours before Abraham Lincoln sat down for the last time at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C., the famous abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison sat down for the first time in Charleston, South Carolina. More than three decades before, Garrison had founded the Boston <em>Liberator,</em> a newspaper dedicated to universal, immediate slave emancipation. In 1833, he helped found the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS), a group devoted to the same goal. And by the time he went to Charleston, Garrison had served as the society’s president for over twenty years. Only in the last few, however, had emancipation changed from a despised, minority opinion to the official policy of federal armies in a cataclysmic civil war. With the war now ending and a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery awaiting ratification, Garrison had come to Fort Sumter to attend a flag-raising ceremony at the invitation of Lincoln’s administration.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

110407%The Digital Early Republic%digital-early-republic.html%April 7, 2011%Thu, 07 Apr 2011 00:00:00 CDT%<p>It may still be the case that historians, as a whole, are <a href="http://tedunderwood.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/why-search-was-the-killer-app-in-text-mining-and-what-we-might-learn-from-it/#comments">averse to using databases of digitized primary sources in their research</a>. My impression is that this is rapidly changing, however. This impression is admittedly unscientific and based only on the scholarship that I read. My perceptions may also be skewed by the fact that I myself have found digital databases useful in my research, as illustrated by <a href="http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=126">my last post</a> on a Lincoln quote and my previous series on <a href="http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=46">John Brown’s Timbuctoo</a>.</p>

110402%New light on a Lincoln quote%new-light-on-lincoln-quote.html%April 2, 2011%Sat, 02 Apr 2011 00:00:00 CDT%<p>In an age of word clouds, topic modeling, text mining, and infinite archives, it’s not surprising that many discussions about digital history focus on the “big” uses of things like keyword searching and digitized texts. For historians, access to huge archives of online text raises important questions about <a href="http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/hownot2read.html">how to read—and how not to read—a million books</a>. Big archives also create exciting opportunities for visualization and text analysis like <a href="http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/projects/lincoln/media/pinsker/">Building the Digital Lincoln</a>, Rob Nelson’s <a href="http://americanpast.richmond.edu/dispatch/">Mining the Dispatch</a>, and Cameron Blevins’ <a href="http://historying.org/2009/08/31/text-analysis-of-martha-ballards-diary-part-1/">work on Martha Ballard’s diary</a>.</p>

120724%Trusting the Water Cure%trusting-water-cure.html%July 24, 2012%Tue, 24 Jul 2012 00:00:00 CDT%<p>Historians of the early republic now understand a great deal about how the post office, the steam engine, the telegraph, and the printing press helped to stitch a growing nation together while simultaneously connecting Americans to a wider world. The “water cure,” a nineteenth-century health reform movement also known as hydropathy, was in many ways the perfect example of how an antebellum “communications revolution” created extensive information networks on even the most obscure topics. After its genesis in Austria in the 1830s and 1840s, by the 1850s the “water cure” claimed a transatlantic following with devotees as diverse as Charles Darwin, Stonewall Jackson, David Ruggles, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and a host of unknown clients from Russia, Germany, Italy, and beyond. By the beginning of the Civil War, the New York City newspaper, <em>The Water-Cure Journal</em>, claimed tens of thousands of subscribers, and over 200 hydropathic establishments dotted the country from upstate New York, to Biloxi, Mississippi, and Salem, Oregon.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

In my very first semester, for example, I took an introductory logic course with <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~hpscdept/people/allen.shtml">Colin Allen</a>, now at Indiana University. I loved the logic, but even more important for my development as a student were the conversations I had with Allen outside of class, on topics ranging from science to computer programming to the philosophy of religion.</p>

I’ve also sometimes used Google Docs in the classroom for similar purposes. The advantage of doing this, of course, is that the Google Doc created during class can later be shared with students online. And because Google Docs can be edited collaboratively by several users at once, it also makes it possible to reproduce the old pedagogical technique of having students “go to the board” to write down responses without ever requiring that they leave their seats.</p>

One of the main reasons why I bought an iPad when it came out was to help with this task; since I ride the bus and light rail to work most days, I wanted an easy way to take my grading and reading with me, without having to lug a huge stack of papers around. My friend’s email gives me a good excuse to briefly summarize the steps I take to use my iPad for grading, and to share some of my reflections on how it’s worked out so far.</p>
080801%How to Read for History%howtoread.html%August 1, 2008%Fri, 01 Aug 2008 00:00:00 CDT%<p>History courses usually have heavy reading loads. But you can make the load lighter if you develop effective strategies for reading. This page is designed to introduce history students to some of those strategies, but these tips are not the last word on reading effectively. Hone your own reading strategies. Practice different strategies over periods of time. And be sure to consult <a href="#further-reading-on-reading">the advice of others</a> about how to read.</p>
