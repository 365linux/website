111001#Applescript and Notational Velocity#applescript-and-notational-velocity.html#October 1, 2011#Sat, 01 Oct 2011 00:00:00 CDT#<p>In an earlier post, I explained <a href="http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=153">how I use plain text files and Notational Velocity as a task-management alternative</a> to the GTD program <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>. Towards the end of that post, I also hinted that I have been able to automate parts of my system by using some Applescript and Automator tricks. Most of these tricks depend on using an apparently little-known feature of Notational Velocity, which is the ability to perform the “search” command on your notes using Applescript.</p>
100920#In Which I Digitally Archive Some Articles#digitally-archive-articles.html#September 20, 2010#Mon, 20 Sep 2010 00:00:00 CDT#<p>Several months ago, I learned about Rice University’s <a href="http://scholarship.rice.edu/">Digital Scholarship Archive</a>, an institutional repository where faculty members can store and share published and unpublished work online. Many universities now have such repositories, including the <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/55467/browse?type=dateissued&amp;submit_browse=By+Date">University of Michigan</a>, <a href="https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a>, and others. But as Shane Landrum (<a href="http://twitter.com/cliotropic/status/21352071993">@cliotropic</a>) recently suggested, I’m not sure history faculty are widely aware of these repositories. I know that without a tip from the great Lisa Spiro (<a href="http://twitter.com/lisaspiro">@lisaspiro</a>), I might not have learned of Rice’s DSA at all. But I’m glad I did, and here’s why and how I’ve posted some of my published work to the repository.</p>
110717#H-Net 2.0?#h-net-2.html#July 17, 2011#Sun, 17 Jul 2011 00:00:00 CDT#<p>Several years ago now, <a href="http://edwired.org/2007/09/10/the-end-of-h-net/">Mills Kelly wrote a provocative post</a> suggesting that the future of <a href="http://www.h-net.org/">H-Net</a> was bleak. After noting that the traffic on many of H-Net’s edited, subject-specific e-mail lists was declining, Kelly argued that e-mail lists had outlived their usefulness for scholars online. “If H-Net is going to survive into a second decade,” he said, “I would urge its leadership to give up on email and move on. Digital communities in the Web 2.0 world just aren’t created in email any more.”</p>
110524#Plain-Text GTD#plain-text-gtd.html#May 24, 2011#Tue, 24 May 2011 00:00:00 CDT#<p>This post does just what its title says, so if terms like <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/an-introduction-to-gtd-getting-things-done/22719">GTD</a>, <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, and <a href="http://notational.net">Notational Velocity</a> mean nothing to you, you may want to move along: there’s nothing to see here but an excruciating display of plain-text nerdiness.</p>
120501#Two Simple Timers#two-simple-timers.html#May 1, 2012#Tue, 01 May 2012 00:00:00 CDT#<p>Like <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/an-everyday-essential-the-timer/22675">Natalie Houston</a> and the Profhacker gang, I sometimes use a timer to keep me on task when I need to be productive, especially when the tasks at hand are ones that I’d rather put off. But instead of investing in a full-blown timer program, I’ve hacked together two simple timers for my Mac that I can fire up whenever I need them. Both are rough around the edges, but they work for me.</p>
110309#The Case of John L. Brown#case-of-john-l-brown.html#March 9, 2011#Wed, 09 Mar 2011 00:00:00 CST#<p>Last Friday, I was very fortunate to be a presenter at the annual conference of the <a href="http://spinner.cofc.edu/atlanticworld/?referrer=webcluster&amp;">Carolina Lowcountry and the Atlantic World program</a> at the College of Charleston. This year’s topic, <a href="http://spinner.cofc.edu/atlanticworld/civilwar/index.html">“Civil War–Global Conflict,”</a> attracted a great slate of fascinating papers.</p>

But measured in miles, the Civil War is not very far away at all, even here in Houston.</p>
110407#The Digital Early Republic#digital-early-republic.html#April 7, 2011#Thu, 07 Apr 2011 00:00:00 CDT#<p>It may still be the case that historians, as a whole, are <a href="http://tedunderwood.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/why-search-was-the-killer-app-in-text-mining-and-what-we-might-learn-from-it/#comments">averse to using databases of digitized primary sources in their research</a>. My impression is that this is rapidly changing, however. This impression is admittedly unscientific and based only on the scholarship that I read. My perceptions may also be skewed by the fact that I myself have found digital databases useful in my research, as illustrated by <a href="http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=126">my last post</a> on a Lincoln quote and my previous series on <a href="http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=46">John Brown’s Timbuctoo</a>.</p>
100811#In Search of John Brown’s Timbucto, Part I#john-brown-timbuctoo-part1.html#August 11, 2010#Wed, 11 Aug 2010 00:00:00 CDT#<p>Recently the <em>Washington Post</em> reported on the ongoing excavation of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080205217.html">a nineteenth-century African American settlement called Timbuctoo</a> in New Jersey. This long-buried community, now evident only in the traces of found Mason jars, crumbling bricks, and the memories of the community’s living descendants, was founded in the 1820s “by freed blacks and escaped slaves” who bought the land from Quaker abolitionists.</p>

110402#New light on a Lincoln quote#new-light-on-lincoln-quote.html#April 2, 2011#Sat, 02 Apr 2011 00:00:00 CDT#<p>In an age of word clouds, topic modeling, text mining, and infinite archives, it’s not surprising that many discussions about digital history focus on the “big” uses of things like keyword searching and digitized texts. For historians, access to huge archives of online text raises important questions about <a href="http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/hownot2read.html">how to read—and how not to read—a million books</a>. Big archives also create exciting opportunities for visualization and text analysis like <a href="http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/projects/lincoln/media/pinsker/">Building the Digital Lincoln</a>, Rob Nelson’s <a href="http://americanpast.richmond.edu/dispatch/">Mining the Dispatch</a>, and Cameron Blevins’ <a href="http://historying.org/2009/08/31/text-analysis-of-martha-ballards-diary-part-1/">work on Martha Ballard’s diary</a>.</p>

110526#Wendell Phillips and the “Ever-Restless Ocean” of Democracy#wendell-phillips-ever-restless-ocean.html#May 26, 2011#Thu, 26 May 2011 00:00:00 CDT#<p>Next week I’m going to be speaking at the <a href="http://www.wendellphillips.org/">Wendell Phillips Bicentennial Commemoration</a> at the Harvard Law School in Cambridge, and this post is a more extended version of the remarks I’m planning to make at the symposium on Friday. It’s also a post that discusses the Wendell Phillips quote that has provided me with a new title for my book manuscript: <em>The Ever-Restless Ocean</em>. Comments and feedback are welcome, and if you’re in Cambridge or Boston next week, you may want to take advantage of the <a href="http://www.wendellphillips.org/events.php">events</a> that are planned for the commemoration by registering now.</p>
120405#Announcing the Dick Dowling Digital Archive#announcing-dick-dowling-archive.html#April 5, 2012#Thu, 05 Apr 2012 00:00:00 CDT#<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce the unveiling of the Dick Dowling Digital Archive and the related exhibit, <a href="http://exhibits.library.rice.edu/exhibits/show/dick-dowling">Dick Dowling and Sabine Pass in History and Memory</a>. The collection and the exhibit, both proudly powered by <a href="http://www.omeka.org">Omeka</a>, were produced by myself and undergraduate students in Civil War history at Rice University in collaboration with <a href="http://library.rice.edu/collections/WRC">the Woodson Research Center</a> at Fondren Library, the <a href="http://digital.houstonlibrary.org/cdm/">Houston Area Digital Archives</a>, and the <a href="http://hrc.rice.edu">Humanities Research Center</a>.</p>
111013#Google Docs and Group Work#google-docs-and-group-work.html#October 13, 2011#Thu, 13 Oct 2011 00:00:00 CDT#<p>Mark Sample recently had a <a href="http://www.samplereality.com/2011/09/14/on-reading-aloud-in-the-classroom/">great post about reading aloud in the classroom</a>, in the course of which he also briefly revealed how he uses Google Docs as a sort of digital whiteboard for collecting responses from students. I’ve also sometimes used Google Docs in the classroom for similar purposes. The advantage of doing this, of course, is that the Google Doc created during class can later be shared with students online. And because Google Docs can be edited collaboratively by several users at once, it also makes it possible to reproduce the old pedagogical technique of having students “go to the board” to write down responses without ever requiring that they leave their seats.</p>
110313#Grading with my iPad#grading-with-my-ipad.html#March 13, 2011#Sun, 13 Mar 2011 00:00:00 CDT#<p>A friend recently emailed me to ask how I feel about using my iPad to grade student papers. One of the main reasons why I bought an iPad when it came out was to help with this task; since I ride the bus and light rail to work most days, I wanted an easy way to take my grading and reading with me, without having to lug a huge stack of papers around. My friend’s email gives me a good excuse to briefly summarize the steps I take to use my iPad for grading, and to share some of my reflections on how it’s worked out so far.</p>
080801#How to Read for History#howtoread.html#August 1, 2008#Fri, 01 Aug 2008 00:00:00 CDT#<p>History courses usually have heavy reading loads. But you can make the load lighter if you develop effective strategies for reading. This page is designed to introduce history students to some of those strategies, but these tips are not the last word on reading effectively. Hone your own reading strategies. Practice different strategies over periods of time. And be sure to consult <a href="#further-reading-on-reading">the advice of others</a> about how to read.</p>
120113#Methods in U.S. Cultural History#methods-in-us-cultural-history.html#January 13, 2012#Fri, 13 Jan 2012 00:00:00 CST#<p>Today I started teaching my semester-long graduate seminar, HIST 587: Methods in U.S. Cultural History. The <a href="http://caleb.mcdaniel.web.rice.edu/pdf/hist587syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> I will be using is very similar to the one I used in the <a href="http://caleb.mcdaniel.web.rice.edu/pdf/hist587.pdf">Fall 2009</a> semester, in that the major objective will be to produce a draft of an article-length essay based on original research. But I am also going to be trying at least two new things this time around.</p>

This post contains a rough outline of what I plan to say, as well as links to resources that I will mention at the workshop.</p>
