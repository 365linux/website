Caleb McDaniel's Website
========================

This repository contains the plain text files I use to generate [my website](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu). As explained on my [Colophon](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/colophon.html), I use a simple bash shell script to run these files through pandoc and generate the files I upload to my server. The shell script is in this repository as `pansite.sh`.
