-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tomorrow at noon, I am going to be speaking about blogging and teaching
at a “brown bag” [workshop at the Digital Media
Center](http://library.rice.edu/events/dr.-caleb-mcdaniel-on-classroom-blogging)
at Rice. This post contains a rough outline of what I plan to say, as
well as links to resources that I will mention at the workshop.

My comments will fall into three categories:

1.  I’ll survey how I’ve actually used blogs in my past courses, to give
    a sense of the variety of possible formats available with a fairly
    low amount of technical know-how.
2.  I’ll share some general lessons and tips I think I’ve learned from
    these experiences.
3.  I’ll briefly talk about the technical side of setting up blogs and
    maintaining them over the course of a semester, focusing
    particularly on how to use the WordPress MU installation, [Blogs @
    Rice University.](http://blogs.rice.edu/)

\
 Here is [my slide
presentation](http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~wcm1/pdf/teachingblogsslides.pdf)
for the talk.

**Part I: Examples**

[PLEASE NOTE: Some of the blogs linked below can only be viewed by users
on the Rice University campus network.]

First, let me summarize briefly how I’ve personally used blogs in the
classroom. This is not an exhaustive list, and some of these examples
work better as warnings than as models, but these illustrate how many
permutations are possible even within fairly narrow parameters. I’ll
talk tomorrow in greater depth about what worked and what didn’t.

*Early Attempts, Mixed Results*

-   [American Activists Abroad](http://activistsabroad.blogspot.com)
    (2004), an upper-level history seminar. (Related: [instructional
    handout](http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~wcm1/pdf/blogsetupex.pdf) and
    [“welcome”
    post](http://activistsabroad.blogspot.com/2004/09/welcome.html).)
-   [Nineteenth-Century America](http://hist2520.blogspot.com) (2008), a
    survey course with emphasis on analysis of primary sources. (NOTE:
    the page linked above will not render correctly in your browser–this
    blog was originally published on a server at another institution, so
    restoring the blog with its original “style” and look would take
    some work. But you can read the posts and comments. Also see my
    overly convoluted
    [rubric](http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~wcm1/pdf/blogrubricex.pdf)
    (PDF) for evaluating the blogging assignment in this course.)
-   [The Rise of Transnational Activism](http://hist396.wordpress.com)
    (2008), an upper-level history seminar. (See [the assignment
    explanation](http://hist396.wordpress.com/assignments/).)

*Later Attempts, Better Results*

-   [American Radicals and Reformers](http://hist423.wordpress.com)
    (2008), an upper-level history seminar. (Look for explanation of
    blogging [assignments](http://hist423.wordpress.com/assignments/) in
    two places, under “Blog Post” and under “Seminar Contributions.”)
-   [American Radicals and Reformers](http://hist423.blogs.rice.edu)
    (2010), an upper-level history seminar. (See explanation of comments
    assignment [here](http://hist423.blogs.rice.edu/assignments/).)
-   [Legendary Americans](http://hist159.blogs.rice.edu) (2009), a
    freshman seminar with the most complex blog set-up I’ve used. In
    addition to a main course blog where I posted reading questions and
    general announcements, students contributed to small group blogs
    (see the links under “Links”). On these group blogs, students made
    one weekly post responding to one of my posted reading questions and
    one weekly post reporting on progress with a group project they were
    working on. (See assignment discussion
    [here](http://hist159.blogs.rice.edu/assignments/).)

In these case studies, using a blog fulfilled various functions, ranging
from course management to student discussion and the monitoring of
semester-long projects. These blogs varied in terms of how much
direction I gave in my prompts, and in how much posting students were
expected to do. This list doesn’t contain examples of other possible
uses of blogs in the classroom, like having each student create his/her
own blog to do free writing or journal-ing, or to create stand-alone
webpages.

**Part II: Reflections and Tips**

These tips may read like directives, but they are really things that I’m
telling myself as I reflect on these varied experiences. The “you” in
these sentences is primarily me.

1.  A blog is not a silver bullet for sparking student participation.
    Don’t assume students will be familiar with the medium, or that they
    will automatically talk more in a blog setting, or that they will
    “check in” regularly without good reasons for doing so.
2.  A blogging assignment is a type of writing assignment. The same
    sorts of guidelines that make a writing assignment good (i.e.,
    specific prompts, clear expectations, etc.) apply to blogging
    assignments.
3.  The more you engage with the blog (posting, commenting, [flagging
    good
    posts](http://hist159.blogs.rice.edu/2009/09/21/weekend-roundup/),
    mentioning posts in classroom discussion) the more students will
    engage with the blog. If you leave the blog alone and seldom make an
    appearance, students will tend to do the same.
4.  The compelling reasons for using a blog depend on what learning
    objectives you want to advance, so be sure you have a clear
    objective in mind before assigning blog posts. Would another type of
    assignment work better or as well?

For me, blogs help advance my objective of teaching students to write.
The virtue of having them respond to readings online–where other
students or non-class members can read what they write–is that it
encourages them to think about audience, clarity, and the use of
evidence. Writing only for me, the Audience of One (aka The Grader), has
its advantages, too. But if I want to teach general habits of good
communication that will “export” well to other settings, then blogging
has particular virtues. When prompts are specific, expectations are
clear, and my engagement with the blog is sufficient, online posts and
comments also serve as excellent springboards for in-class discussions.

**Part III: Technical Stuff**

At the workshop I’ll talk a little bit about using WordPress MU and will
even set up an example blog that will appear
[here](http://hist246.blogs.rice.edu) once we’ve made it. A few things I
want to highlight are: how to manage Users, how to create and use
“Categories,” how to change Themes, and how to manage widgets.

I’ll also discuss the management of “privacy” settings. In past Rice
courses where I have allowed the blog to be seen by anyone on the
Internet, I have asked students to sign [a Blog Consent
Form](http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~wcm1/pdf/blogconsent.pdf) (PDF).

Finally, I’ll have some suggestions for how to manage your workflow if
you use a Course Blog, including a brief introduction to RSS readers.
(Here’s a post I’ve provided to students [explaining
RSS](http://hist423.wordpress.com/2008/08/28/thursday-bullets/).)
