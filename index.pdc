I am an historian of the nineteenth-century United States at Rice University. On this site you can find my [publications][], occasional posts on my current research and teaching, and some geeky computer tricks.

My first book, *The Problem of Democracy in the Age of Slavery: Garrisonian Abolitionists and Transatlantic Reform*, is forthcoming from [LSU Press][] in 2013. In the meantime, you can read [the introduction](./book-introduction.html). In the fall 2012-2013 academic year I will be leading a Humanities Research Center [Masterclass on Digital History](http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu). I am otherwise on leave in the fall 2012 semester.

I also [tweet][], [pin][], [tumble][], [git][], and [LibraryThing][].
